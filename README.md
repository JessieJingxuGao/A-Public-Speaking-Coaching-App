## Project Narrative
For many people, public speaking is scarier than spiders, heights, and even death...but business doesnâ€™t care. In business, captivating your audience is critical to getting that job or landing that deal.  </br>
We develop Sonorus, an automated public speaking coach that reinforces practice through fun, custom presentation environments.</br>
Using real-time speech analysis in a simulated practice environment, Sonorus equips professionals with the confidence to become compelling communicators.
